# Platform Investigation

Investigation and analysis of different platforms for the display of digital
humanities information with temporal and spatial data (timelines and maps) and
the collection of digital humanities information from users. Platforms
investigated include HistoryPin, Omeka, and Google Tour Builder.

## Omeka Prototype Archive

omekaPrototypeArchive.zip contains a backup of the Omeka prototype used to
investigate that platform.  It contains a backup of the Omeka folder from the
prototype's web server, and a dump of the associated MySQL database.
